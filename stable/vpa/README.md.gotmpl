# VPA

A chart to install the [Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler)

This chart is entirely based on the manifests and various scripts in the `deploy` and `hack` directories of the VPA repository.

## Tests and Debugging

There are a few tests included with this chart that can help debug why your installation of VPA isn't working as expected. You can run `helm test -n <Release Namespace> <Release Name>` to run them.

* `checkpoint-crd-available` - Checks for the verticalpodautoscalercheckpoints CRD
* `crd-available` - Checks for the verticalpodautoscalers CRD
* `metrics-api-available` - Checks to make sure that the metrics api endpoint is available. If it's not, install [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) in your cluster
* `create-vpa` - A simple check to make sure that VPA objects can be created in your cluster. Does not check for functionality of that VPA.

## Components

There are three primary components to the Vertical Pod Autoscaler that can be enabled individually here.

* recommender
* updater
* admissionController

The admissionController is the only one that poses a stability consideration because it will create a mutatingwebhookconfiguration in your cluster. This _could_ cause the cluster to stop accepting pod creation requests if it is not configured correctly. Because of this, it is disabled by default in this chart. The recommender and updater are enabled by default.

For more details, please see the values below, and the vertical pod autosclaer documentation.

## *BREAKING* Upgrading from v0.x.x to v1.x.x

In the previus version, when admissionController.cleanupOnDelete flag passed to true, mutatingwebhookconfiguration and the tls secret for the admission controller is removed. There was no chance to pass any image information to start remove process. Now, it could be passed custom image by version 1.0.0.

```
cleanupOnDelete:
    enabled: true
    image:
      repository: quay.io/reactiveops/ci-images
      tag: v11-alpine

```

## Installation

```bash
helm repo add fairwinds-stable https://charts.fairwinds.com/stable
helm install vpa fairwinds-stable/vpa --namespace vpa --create-namespace
```

## Utilize Prometheus for History

In order to utilize prometheus for recommender history, you will need to pass some extra flags to the recommender. If you use prometheus operator installed in the `prometheus-operator` namespace, these values will do the trick.

```
recommender:
  extraArgs:
    prometheus-address: |
      http://prometheus-operator-prometheus.prometheus-operator.svc.cluster.local:9090
    storage: prometheus
```
