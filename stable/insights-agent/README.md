# Fairwinds Insights Agent

The Fairwinds Insights Agent is a collection of reporting tools, which send data back
to [Fairwinds Insights](https://insights.fairwinds.com).

## Installation
We recommend installing `insights-agent` in its own namespace.

```
helm repo add fairwinds-stable https://charts.fairwinds.com/stable
helm upgrade --install insights-agent fairwinds-stable/insights-agent \
  --namespace insights-agent \
  --set insights.organization=acme-co \
  --set insights.cluster=staging \
  --set insights.base64token="abcde=="
```

## CronJob schedules
Most Insights reports run as CronJobs, typically every hour.

In order to avoid every report consuming resources at once, you can stagger the reports
by setting the minute of the cron schedule to a random number. For example,
to run at a random minute every hour, your cron expression can be `rand * * * *`.

## Reports
There are several different report types which can be enabled and configured:
* `polaris`
* `goldilocks`
* `workloads`
* `kubehunter`
* `trivy`
* `kubesec`
* `releasewatcher`

See below for configuration details.
