## Intro

This is a Helm chart for the Fairwinds [Goldilocks project](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/goldilocks). It provides an easy way to install the controller and the dashboard for viewing resource recommendations in your Kubernetes cluster. Please see the [Goldilocks README](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/goldilocks) for more information.

## Installation
```bash
helm repo add fairwinds-stable https://charts.fairwinds.com/stable
helm install goldilocks fairwinds-stable/goldilocks --namespace goldilocks
```

## Requirements

This has a hard requirement on VPA being installed. Please see the [Goldilocks README](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/goldilocks)

## vpa subchart

Fairwinds has published a chart for installing VPA [in our stable repo](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/charts/tree/master/stable/vpa). It can be enabled as a sub-chart by setting `vpa.enabled==true`. We recommend just installing the chart and managing it separately.

## Major Version Upgrade Notes

## *BREAKING* Upgrading from v4.x.x to v5.x.x

The new chart version includes [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) configuration for the `networking.k8s.io/v1` Kubernetes API.

Because of the new API version, you need to specify `dashboard.ingress.hosts[X].paths[Y].type` when installing this chart with enabled Ingress on a Kubernetes cluster version 1.19+.

## Upgrading from v3.x.x to v4.x.x

There are no breaking changes, but the goldilocks controller and dashboard have had some major tweaks so they can work with more workload controllers. To allow v4.0.0+ to work with more than Deployments, the main change here is in RBAC permissions so that the goldilocks service accounts can access all resources in the `apps/v1`.

## *BREAKING* Upgrading from v2.x.x to v3.x.x

In this change, the `installVPA` value and corresponding hooks have been removed in favor of the sub-chart. The recommended path forward is to remove the hook-installed resources and manage the VPA installation with the [Fairwinds VPA Chart](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/charts/tree/master/stable/vpa)

We have kept the `uninstallVPA` flag in place, which will remove a vpa installation that was previously managed by this chart. This flag will be deprecated in a later release.

## *BREAKING* Upgrading to chart v2.x.x from v1.x.x

If using `installVPA=true` when updating from v1.x.x to v2.x.x of this chart, there are some considerations. v2.x.x of the chart started only installing the recommender and the necessary CRDs and RBAC from the VPA installation. This is due to the volatile and risky nature of running a beta mutatingadmissionwebhook in your cluster. If you have previously used the `installVPA=true` flag to install the VPA, we recommend that you completely uninstall and re-install the VPA as part of the upgrade. We have provided a new hook to do this that will run before the install hook.

If upgrading from v1.x.x to v2.x.x we recommend upgrading like so:

```
helm upgrade goldilocks fairwinds-stable/goldilocks --set reinstallVPA=true
```

This will completely remove the VPA and then re-install it using the new method.
