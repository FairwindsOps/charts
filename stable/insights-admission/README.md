# Fairwinds Insights Admission Controller

## Intro

This is an Admission Controller to reject deployment of objects into your Kubernetes cluster that woudld create dangerous action items in [Fairwinds Insights](https://insights.fairwinds.com)

## Installation

A valid TLS certificate is required for this admission controller to work. If you have cert-manager installed then everything should work out of the box. If you don't use cert-manager and don't want to install it then you can supply a CA Bundle with the `caBundle` parameter and create a TLS secret and pass the name of that secret as `secretName`.

```bash
helm repo add fairwinds-stable https://charts.fairwinds.com/stable
helm install insights-admission fairwinds-stable/insights-admission \
  --namespace insights-admission \
  --set insights.organization=acme-co \
  --set insights.cluster=staging \
  --set insights.base64token="dG9rZW4="
```

If you have an additional type of object to monitor with this admission controller then you can add a values file that looks like this.

```
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - custom
  apiVersions:
  - v1
  operations:
  - CREATE
  - UPDATE
  resources:
  - customResource
  scope: Namespaced
```
