# Basic Kubernetes Demo

Runs a frontend that shows which pods it is connecting to.  Good for scaling demos.

## A Note on Chart Version 0.3.0+

Due to the [future deprecation](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/) of various `extensions/v1beta1` API's, the 0.3.0 version of this chart will only work on kubernetes 1.14.0+
