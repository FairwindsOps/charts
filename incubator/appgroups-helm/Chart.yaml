  This chart is an example of how an end-user might use Helm to template a large
  number of appGroups and policyMappings. It uses helm templates with yaml anchors
  in the values file to pre-define groups of labels or clusters, and then uses a
  {{with}} block to allow defining all the appGroups and policyMappings in one place
